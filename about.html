          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my corner on the Internet.</h1>
          <p> I am a small town guy from India with big dreams. I started my career as a chemical engineer with Reliance Industries. Sense of 
            meaning and higher purpose brought me into education sector where I have spent more than eighty percent of my working life. In the process, I created active
            learning products for school students in India and also wrote a <a href="https://t.co/5FitN1Mo83?amp=1">book</a> for school teachers helping them implement 21st century teaching
            methods in their classes.
          </p>

          <p>Currently I am in the pursuit of achieving excellence in personal and professional life. I have launched a <a href="http://www.myjobpreparation.com">platform</a> for working 
            professional to help them in preparation for job interviews. My overall objective behind this initiative to improve the employability
            skills as mass scale.
          </p>
          <p>Apart from regular work, I practice <a href="https://medium.com/@adrohilla">writing</a> and coding and love walking in woods with my wife.
